# Hartstikke Webflow Starter ðŸ’™

This is a basic setup with [ViteJs](https://vitejs.dev/) that you can use for your Webflow website.
`jQuery` is already installed and declared as an external dependency.

I'm using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to build and host my code because it's easy to use, free, and has serverless functions out of the box. Feel free to use your favorite CDN.

**If you prefer TypeScript you can use [this template](https://github.com/armandsalle/vite-typescript-webflow)**

## Building and running on localhost

This project is using `yarn`.

First, install dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

To launch a local dev server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

To create a production build:

```sh
yarn build
```

To clean the local `/dist` folder:

```sh
yarn clean
```

To lint the code with ESLint and Prettier:

```sh
yarn lint:fix
```
